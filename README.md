# My neovim configuration

This was highly inpired by this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) from ThePrimeagen. The repository is this [https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua).

I am in this journey to live more in the terminal, so I'll be using neovim only to coding.
